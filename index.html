                It was my first project,the page made only with HTML and CSS. It
                has the same design as the original and the nav is made just
                HTML and CSS without JavaScript. It is a fully responsive page
                that changes for tablet or mobile. All links take you to
                different pages related to the phonehouse page.

                In this responsive page, I work with HTML and CSS too,

                In this housing rental page, three distinct sections are
                highlighted: header, main, and footer, which appear differently
                on tablet or mobile formats thanks to responsive techniques.
                Once again, I utilized HTML and CSS for the design, including
                the navigation bar with a hamburger menu.

                This fashion page employs JavaScript and features three filters:
                sellers, style, and price. This enables users to save time in
                their clothing search. While the page design draws inspiration
                from the renowned brand Shein, it incorporates unique elements
                in terms of clothing, filters, and the footer

                This page, inspired by the well-known platform 'Pinterest,'
                requests photos from an API based on a specific theme that can
                be searched through the top search bar. The layout is
                reminiscent of this platform, yet the rest of the design is
                original.

                It includes the typical sections found in a CV: education,
                experience, and projects. Additionally, there is a small search
                bar for various mastered technologies. I have included links to
                my Netlify and Vercel pages, as well as a button that directly

                This project features three popular games: Rock, Paper,
                Scissors, Memory, and Hangman. It has a main page that leads you
                to each of them. In the first game, you face off against the
                computer in a best-of-10 match, and the score is stored in the
                local storage. For Memory, I use a grid to create a table of
                animals, and it keeps track of the best score. Finally, Hangman
                contains a secret word, and as you miss letters, the hangman
                image changes

                This is a React frontend for a multi-spa management system, with
                a Node.js backend. The application allows customers and admins
                to manage customer data and spa locations. Key features include
                user authentication with JWT, dynamic customer and spa
                management with CRUD operations, custom hooks for state
                management (useCustomers, useSpas), and responsive forms with
                real-time validation. Admins have special access to add, edit,
                and delete customer and spa information, while regular users can
                view their details and book spa services.
